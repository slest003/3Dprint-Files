//simple repos for uploading files from learning Blender tutorials

This folder is specifically for things we create from the tutorials.


Updates:
   
   1: myCup.stl is my first .stl file I made from following a tutorial.

   2: donut.stl is, believe it or not, a donut. (with a healthy amount of frosting.)
