# Project Bat
Simple repos for uploading files we design.
There will be several folders; one for tutorial items from learning. One for practice models we make for ourselves. One for the final Batarang product.



Updates:
   
   1: myCup.stl is my first .stl file I made from following a tutorial.

   2: donut.stl is, believe it or not, a donut. (with a healthy amount of frosting.)
